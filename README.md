# Basic JS hover animations.

## Instructions

Start the project like you would any React project. There's no optimizations for anything right now, just wanted to try out hover animations with vanilla JS converted into a React package. Data is from a custom .json file in ` src `.

## Reuse

Feel free to implement this in whatever project or codebase you want, but remember the icons aren't mine - they're available for free on Pixeltrue.
